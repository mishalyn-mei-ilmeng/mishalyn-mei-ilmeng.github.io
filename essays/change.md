## Another Class, Another Language

Since I’ve started attending UH Manoa, I’ve encountered Java, Python, C, C++ and recently, Javascript and Typescript. After learning Java, I thought I would hate every new language I would encounter and looked forward to learning Python. In ICS 141, I used Python for a handful of homework submissions, but I never truly felt like I learned it. I hated its simplicity and the stark contrast in syntax compared to Java, which I had already started to get more comfortable with. However, when it came to learning C and C++, I immediately fell in love. I thought pointers were fun and felt like the languages taught me a lot about memory management. Since I love Java, C, and C++, I assumed Python would be the only language I disliked using. I was proved wrong yet again.   
Compared to the languages I’ve encountered so far, Javascript and Typescript do not feel much different outside of the syntax. I like the simplicity of the data types since there are only three. However, there are some concepts like arrow functions and destructuring that I’m not particularly fond of. I feel like they make things more complicated and unclear than they could be. Typescript feels like a mix of the discomfort that I felt with Python and complications beyond what I had experienced with C. Whether this discomfort is due to the class’s fast pace or the unfamiliarity, only time will tell.

## Embracing Discomfort

Every time I begin a new topic or class on the ICS pathway, I always dread the change from the previous teaching style. This semester was no different when I was introduced to the concept of a flipped classroom. I immediately hated the idea because my favorite part of college so far has been the lectures. Throughout college, I often found myself wondering whether or not I was meant to pursue a degree in computer science. Attending lectures would reignite my fire to grow my knowledge and understanding. I often left ICS classes feeling inspired and excited to tackle the next assignment or challenge. Flipped classrooms however, make me feel forced out of my comfort zone. While the modules give some structure, they do not bring the same excitement and inspiration that a good lecture would.   
Whether it’s adjusting to new programming languages like Python, C++, JavaScript, and TypeScript, or adapting to the flipped classroom model, I have to reassure myself that the discomfort is an essential part of my journey. Just like in every other class, these new languages and new concepts are just another reminder that I will only grow if I step outside of my comfort zone. After all, if I had quit after one difficult class, I would never have learned my love for coding
